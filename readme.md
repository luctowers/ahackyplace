# ahackyplace
A hacky scalable implementation of the [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_%28Reddit%29) concept. Implemented in a weekend, guided by both this [keynote from redislabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Xqghoki70) and this [reddit blogpost](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/13/how-we-built-rplace/).

## Tech Used
- NodeJS (web app)
- WebSockets (streaming newly placed pixels to browser)
- Redis (Storing canvas state and pub/sub messaging between instances)

## Running it for Development 
1. Download  and install Redis Server and Redis CLI on your local machine
2. Using Redis CLI, login to the Redis Server and run the following commands:
 - `SET canvas ""`
 - `SET canvas_width 24`
 - `SET canvas_height 24`
 - `SET canvas_bitdepth 4`
 
 You can safely substitute the values of `canvas_width` and `canvas_height` to your liking. While the server is capable of handling bitdepths up to 32, at this time the front-end is only capable of handling a `canvas_bitdepth` of 4.
3. Clone this repository and change directory into it
4. Run `npm install` and `npm run start`

## Adapting for production
The majority of the above applies for production deployment, except your Redis Server will likely not be hosted on the same machine. Ensure that following environment variables are set:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=<your http port here>`
- `REDIS_HOST=<your redis host here>`
- `PORT=<your redis port here>`

If you are using the included Docker configuration note that, `NODE_ENV` and `PORT` are already set in the Dockerfile.
